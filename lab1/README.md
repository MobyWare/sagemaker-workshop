# Use built-in XGBoost algorithm to do logistic regression
In this lab, you will train and use a model to do logistic regression, 
taking advantage of the built-in XGBoost algorithm in SageMaker.

Inside of your notebook instance, navigate to the **SageMaker Examples** tab. Expand the folder 
called **Introduction to Amazon Algorithms**. Find the line called **xgboost_abalone** and
click **Use**.

Navigate to the notebook and follow the documentation provided in the sample notebook.

**abalone example is not logistic regression**
