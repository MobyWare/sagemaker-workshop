# Use built-in XGBoost algorithm to do logistic regression
In this lab, you will train and use a model to do logistic regression, 
taking advantage of the built-in XGBoost algorithm in SageMaker. The use case is for predicting
customer churn for a mobile phone company.

Inside of your notebook instance, navigate to the **SageMaker Examples** tab. Expand the folder 
called **Introduction to Applying Machine Learning**. Find the line called **xgboost_customer_churn** and
click **Use**.

Navigate to the notebook and follow the documentation provided in the sample notebook.
