# Use built-in XGBoost algorithm to do logistic regression
In this lab, you will train and use a model to do logistic regression, 
taking advantage of the built-in XGBoost algorithm in SageMaker. The use case is for predicting
customer churn for a mobile phone company.

Inside of your notebook instance, navigate to the **SageMaker Examples** tab. Expand the folder 
called **Introduction to Applying Machine Learning**. Find the line called **xgboost_customer_churn** and
click **Use**.

Click on the **Files** tab and open the new folder created. Click on the Jupyter notebook to start the lab.

Be sure to change the S3 bucket name in the first cell.

Navigate to the notebook and follow the documentation provided in the sample notebook.

If the documentation on Assigning Costs does not display correctly, try navigating to the notebook
in github: https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_applying_machine_learning/xgboost_customer_churn/xgboost_customer_churn.ipynb .
