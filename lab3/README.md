In this lab, you will learn how to bring your own TensorFlow code into Amazon SageMaker. SageMaker provides a TensorFlow container which lets you take full advantage of SageMaker's training service and managed hosting service. You will create a simple neural network with Keras and TensorFlow, train the model, and host it for real-time predictions.

Navigate to the Jupyter notebook provided for this lab and follow the detailed instructions to perform the lab.
