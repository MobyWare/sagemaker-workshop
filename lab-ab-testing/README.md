# Perform A/B testing of a model

In this lab, you will learn how to perform A/B testing when you are ready to deploy a new version of an existing model. This lab has a dependency on the [XGBoost](../lab-xgboost/README.md) lab.

In the [setup lab](../lab-0-setup/README.md), you cloned the workshop GitHub repository. Navigate to the Jupyter notebook provided for this lab in the `lab-ab-testing` folder. Follow the detailed instructions to perform the lab.
