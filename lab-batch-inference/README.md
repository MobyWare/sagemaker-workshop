# lab4
In this lab, you will use a model in batch. There are many use cases that do not require a real-time prediction endpoint, but are more effectively performed in a batch against a large set of observations. We will use a SageMaker-provided sample notebook called `batch_transform_pca_dbscan_movie_clusters.ipynb`. You can find it in the `Advanced functionality` section of the examples tab in your notebook. Use a copy of that sample, and follow its detailed instructions.
